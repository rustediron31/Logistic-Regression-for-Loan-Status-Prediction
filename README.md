# Logistic-Regression-for-Loan-Status-Prediction
The Loan Status Prediction project leverages Logistic Regression to predict whether an individual will default on a loan or not.
1. Introduction:
This repository contains the code and data for predicting loan default status using Logistic Regression. The model is built with popular Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, to handle data preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and visualization.
This project demonstrates how to use Logistic Regression for predicting loan default status. By leveraging historical financial data, the model helps financial institutions make more informed decisions regarding loan approval and risk assessment.
